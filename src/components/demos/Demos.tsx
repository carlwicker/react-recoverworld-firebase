            We love new music and are proud to say that a significant number of
            our new releases have come from demo submissions.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, due to the sheer volume that we receive, we do ask that you
            follow a few simple guidelines that will help get your music to us
            in the best shape and the most convenient format.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>DO NOT</b> send us work in progress. Unfortunately we simply do
              not have the time to coax you through the production process -
              that is what friends are for. When you think you have a great
              track or idea, play it to others and get opinions that you trust
              as to whether your music is of a high enough standard for release.
              If it is, then send it over. If not, then keep working on it until
              it is.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>DO NOT</b> send us more than 2 or 3 tracks. If we want more we
              will ask, so send us your best work and if we like it, we will be
              in touch.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>DO NOT</b> attach files directly to emails. They clog up our
              inbox and are deleted immediately. For submission requirements,
              see below.
            </li>
            <li>
              Include as much information as you can about yourself; previous
              releases, web details, studio details and a phone number. This is
              all useful information but please, no life stories! Be informative
              and succinct!
            </li>
            <li>
              Try to keep your demos as exclusive as possible. If we sign your
              release it will be with a view to selling as many units as
              possible and our job is made much easier if the track isn't
              already all over the Internet.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p style={{ marginTop: "10vh" }}>
            Initially, we now ask for all tracks to be submitted as SoundCloud,
            YouTube, or any other streaming format. We can then click and listen
            and if we like what we hear we will be in touch for a full length
            320 MP3. Whilst we often give a small amount of feedback on track
            rejections, we regret that we cannot reply to everyone or get
            involved in lengthy dialogue, as we simply do not have the time. Due
            to the large volume of demo submissions, we may not be able to
            respond or listen to your work immediately - please allow at least
            two weeks before 'chasing up' as this will only delay the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Good luck â€“ we look forward to hearing from you and hopefully
            working with you in the future!
